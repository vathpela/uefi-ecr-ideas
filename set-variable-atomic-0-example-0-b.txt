The EFI_VARIABLE_TIME_BASED_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS and the EFI_VARIABLE_
AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS attributes may both be set in the returned Attributes bitmask
parameter of a GetVariable() call, though it should be noted that the EFI_VARIABLE_
AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS attribute is deprecated and should no longer be used. The
EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE and EFI_VARIABLE_ATOMIC_REPLACE attributes will never be set
in the returned Attributes bitmask parameter.

Variables stored with the EFI_VARIABLE_ATOMIC_REPLACE attribute set must be guaranteed
to have been updated in their respective storage unless an error is returned.

Variables stored with the EFI_VARIABLE_ENHANCED_AUTHENTICATED_ACCESS attribute set will return
metadata in addition to variable data when GetVariable() is called. If a GetVariable() call indicates that
this attribute is set, the GetVariable() payload must be interpreted according to the metadata headers. In
addition to the headers described in SetVariable(), the following header is used to indicate what
certificate may be currently associated with a variable.
