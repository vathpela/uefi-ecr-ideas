The Attributes have the following usage rules:
  • If a preexisting variable is rewritten with different attributes, SetVariable()shall not modify
    the variable and shall return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER. The only exception to this is when
    the only attribute differing is EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE or EFI_VARIABLE_ATOMIC_REPLACE.
    In such cases the call's successful outcome or not is determined by the actual value being
    written. There are two exceptions to this rule:
    — If a preexisting variable is rewritten with no access attributes specified, the variable will be deleted.
    — EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE attribute presents a special case. It is acceptable to
      rewrite the variable with or without EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE attribute.
    - EFI_VARIABLE_ATOMIC_REPLACE will cause the variable to be completely replaced if and only
      if the platform firmware can guarantee replacement is an atomic operation.
  • Setting a data variable with no access attributes causes it to be deleted.
  • EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS is deprecated and should not be used.
    Platforms should return EFI_UNSUPPORTED if a caller to SetVariable() specifies this attribute.
  • Unless the EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE,
    EFI_VARIABLE_TIME_BASED_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS, or
    EFI_VARIABLE_ENHANCED_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS attribute is set, setting a data
    variable with zero DataSize specified, causes it to be deleted.
